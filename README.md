Build / nassl
-------------

SSLyze is all Python code but since version 0.7, it uses a custom OpenSSL
wrapper written in C called nassl. The pre-compiled packages for SSLyze
contain a compiled version of this wrapper in sslyze/nassl. If you want to
clone the SSLyze repo, you will have to get a compiled version of nassl from
one of the SSLyze packages and copy it to sslyze-master/nassl, in order to get
SSLyze to run.

The source code for nassl is hosted at https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/nassl.


Py2exe Build
------------

SSLyze can be packaged as a Windows executable by running the following command:

    $ python.exe setup_py2exe.py py2exe


Where do the trust stores come from?
------------------------------------

The Mozilla, Microsoft, Apple and Java trust stores are downloaded using the 
following tool: https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/catt/blob/master/sslyze.md.
